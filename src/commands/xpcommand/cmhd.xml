    <description>
        Holds the given X-Plane command(s) until terminated.

        In X-Plane API this corresponds to `XPLMCommandBegin` with `XPLMCommandEnd` only sent on `TERM` or disconnect.
        X-Plane (on its own) will continuously issue trigger events while being held.

        Note that XPRC command termination may be acknowledged before actual release of the X-Plane command being held.
