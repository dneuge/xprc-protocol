## Text Mode

All messages are transferred as human-readable plain text, terminated using a single line-feed character (LF). For compatibility with manual terminal clients (e.g. `telnet` for debugging), server implementations are recommended to also accept CR LF and CR for line termination. Client implementations should never rely on any such processing and only submit proper LF termination; they also do not need to expect any other line termination. If server implementation choose to, they may adjust line termination to match what a client has previously sent. Clients must not expect servers to implement any such convenience behaviour; plain LF is the only guaranteed line termination.

The protocol mandates US-ASCII (7 bit) as character set as this is the base for UTF-8 as well as most local legacy character sets, which minimizes compatibility issues regardless of local character set choices. Implementations are free to use any character set compatible with US-ASCII but must neither send "extended" characters (outside US-ASCII) nor make assumptions about incompatible client character sets.

In the future, a binary mode may be specified if need for a more compact message format arises, but (also to ease debugging) text mode is currently the only supported mode and shall remain the default mode in future protocol revisions as well.
